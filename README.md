These are the slides for my ELK and Docker talk at [.NET Oxford](https://www.meetup.com/dotnetoxford/) on Tuesday 5th December 2017.

A running version of the slides can [be found here](http://elkdocker-dotnetoxford-slides.azurewebsites.net).

A link to blog post about the evening will follow in the next few days (needs writing first!).
